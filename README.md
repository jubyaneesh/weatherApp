# weatherApp
This Weather Forecast App is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city around the world. 
By entering a city name, the app fetches and displays the current temperature, wind speed, and a description of the weather condition using the Open-Meteo API.
The goal was to build a user-friendly interface with accurate, real-time data and a clean layout.
